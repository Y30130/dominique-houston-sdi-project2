A recording artist var recordingArist = "Britney Spears" is going on tour and will be performing one secret show per month for one year. showsPerYear = 12. daysOfTheWeek = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"].

Every night she must perform for fans var performShow = function (daysOfTheWeek). At the end of every day she would like to know how many shows are left while var (showsRemain > 0), so please inform her immediately.

For each day that has passed, the number of shows left will decrease (var showNumber = 0; showNumber < daysOfTheWeek.length; showNumber++).

You are not to look at her nor are you allowed to respond directly to her, you must relayMessageTo = function(person,message){...}, to which you will normally receive a reply along the lines of recordingArtist + " says thank you."

Though you may get used to it, you won't be able to help by wonder if (staff.talkToHer()) when she responds.
